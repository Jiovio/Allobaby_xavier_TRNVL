"Conception, also known as fertilization, typically occurs approximately two weeks after the beginning of your last menstrual period (LMP). It involves the fertilization of a woman's egg by a man's sperm, usually taking place within one of the fallopian tubes—these tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus (womb). The exact day of conception can be challenging to pinpoint, which is why healthcare providers rely on the date of your LMP to determine the stage of your pregnancy.",

"After fertilization, the egg travels through the fallopian tubes to reach the uterus, where it attaches to the uterine lining—a process known as implantation. Once implanted, the fertilized egg starts to develop, and the placenta begins to form. This organ grows within the uterus and serves to nourish the baby, providing essential nutrients and oxygen through the umbilical cord.",
